# 🧪 Manual Testing Project – SauceDemo Web Application

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is part of my ongoing QA Portfolio, where I am developing hands-on skills across manual testing, API testing, and automated testing as I transition into a Hybrid QA Engineer role.

In Phase 1, I focused on building core manual QA competencies by testing the SauceDemo web application:
🔗 https://www.saucedemo.com/

The goal of this phase was to design structured test cases, execute functional and UI tests, document defects, and produce a professional Test Summary Report — mirroring real QA workflows used in industry.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate the ability to analyze application workflows.
- Create clear, repeatable manual test cases.
- Execute test cases and capture actual results.
- Identify, document, and prioritize bugs with reproduction steps and screenshots.
- Deliver a formal Test Summary Report to showcase QA communication and reporting skills.

🔍 Key Learnings

Throughout this manual testing phase, I strengthened my understanding of:

Designing structured, maintainable test cases

Balancing positive and negative testing

Writing clear and actionable defect reports

Thinking from both user and developer perspectives

Using manual testing to lay the foundation for future automation

🔧 (You can add 2–3 personalized insights here once Phase 1 is complete.)

🧭 Next Steps in My QA Journey

This project marks the completion of Phase 1 of my 6-month QA transition plan.

Next, I will be moving into:

👉 Phase 2 – API Testing with Postman + Newman
I’ll design endpoint tests, validate responses, and begin integrating API work into my hybrid QA workflow.
